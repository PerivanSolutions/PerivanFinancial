  Once the pack is ready to go, the administrator can simply print the pack for
  those who prefer printed copies, or publish the pack to the portal to only
  those who should receive it. The recipient will then automatically be alerted
  by email of its availability.

<p>
  If, for any reason, the pack needs to be withdrawn, it can simply be
  unpublished at a click.

  Shared documents
</h2>
<p>
  Each Virtualboardroom contains a shared documents area specific to the board
  or committee. This can contain any relevant generic corporate governance
  information that will not necessarily be included in the board pack.
